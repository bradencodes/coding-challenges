You have an array of integers nums and an array queries, where queries[i] is a pair of indices (0-based). Find the sum of the elements in nums from the indices at queries[i][0] to queries[i][1] (inclusive) for each query, then add all of the sums for all the queries together. Return that number modulo 109 + 7.
